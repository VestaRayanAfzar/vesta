# vesta

**[Vesta Boot](https://github.com/vestaBoot) Platform**

## Installation

    npm install -g vesta

**Always use `vesta --help` for the latest commends and options**

## Commands

### `vesta create`

This command will create a project using one of our scaffolding templates based on the options you provide [use `vesta create --help` for more information]:

- Server side
  - [RESTful Api](https://github.com/vestaBoot/vesta-template-api) Backend application based on Express framework
- Client side
  - [Client Application](https://github.com/vestaBoot/vesta-template-client) Frontend application based on create-react-app

All these project are common in some files which are exported to a new project ([Common](https://github.com/vestaBoot/vesta-template-cmn))
which will be copied/submoduled into a sub directory of generated project.

If you want to init git repository you have to create them on your remote git repository server before using `vesta create`.

### `vesta gen`

Generate each of the below items [use `vesta gen --help` for more information]:

```
model           [Client, Server]
controller      [Server]
component       [Client]
```

For getting help on any of the above items you may use `vesta gen <item> --help`

### `vesta update`

This command will **UNSAFE** update npm packages that are installed in your project's `package.json` file

- `vesta update` will only update all vesta packages (`@vesta/*`)
- `vesta update --all` will update all packages mentioned at `dependencies`
- `vesta update --dev` will update all packages mentioned at `devDependencies`

### `vesta deploy (httpGitRepository | previousDeployConfigFile) [ext params]`<sup>1</sup>

After cloning the project from the url, the deploy process will start.
Deploy process Will move `resources/ci/deploy.sh` file to the project's root directory and execute it.

Any `ext params` of any kind provided to the commend will be passed to `deploy.sh` script respectively after `CLONE_PATH` and `DEPLOY_PATH`,
so it will be like `/path/to/deploy.sh CLONE_PATH DEPLY_PATH ext params`

### `vesta backup [previousDeployConfigFile]`

This will mount all volumes of this project into a _`busybox`_ image and then export (`docker export`) them into a tar file
named `backup_yyyymmdd-hhmmss.tar`. The container will be removed finally.

If `vesta backup` command is used (without any fileName), the vesta will look for `docker-compose.yml` file in current directory. If it's found based on the volumes on the compose file the backup tar file will be created, otherwise it will
log an error.

_**WARNING!**_ mount volumes will be merged into a single _`busybox`_ container, so if there are more than one directory with the same path even inside different containers, they will be merged together.

1. `previousDeployConfigFile` is the path to the json file generated by `vesta deploy` command
